## 🎯 How to Follow This Roadmap

1️⃣ **Start with the `setup/` folder** to install and configure JavaScript.  
2️⃣ **Move to `basics/`** to build a strong foundation with variables, data types, and loops.  
3️⃣ **Learn about functions in `functions/`** and understand ES6 features.  
4️⃣ **Explore `objects-arrays/`** to master arrays, objects, and modern JavaScript techniques.  
5️⃣ **Advance to `advanced-js/`** to grasp closures, prototypes, event loops, and asynchronous JavaScript.  
6️⃣ **Understand the DOM in `dom/`** to manipulate webpages dynamically.  
7️⃣ **Dive into `web-apis/`** to work with browser features and API requests.  
8️⃣ **Build real-world projects in `projects/`** to practice your skills.  
9️⃣ **Prepare for interviews using `interview-questions/`** and test your knowledge.
